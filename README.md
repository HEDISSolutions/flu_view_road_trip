## Sneeze-Free Zones: A Grandma-Approved Travel Guide

Our project was designed to help travelers in planning a road trip across the United States, while staying informed about flu trends on their way. Using data from the CDC FluView API, the project visualized flu case hotspots with interactive maps and provides a user-friendly way to identify areas to avoid or take precautions if necessary to stop. The dashboard allows users to view flu cases by state and along their route. This ensures that users can make informed decisions for a safer, healthier journey. 
To interact with our project, simply open the heatmap on your favorite internet browser and use the tabs to fetch data and display the interactive map. 
As for our ethical considerations, we strongly prioritized user privacy when downloading and using data provided by the CDC. We understand using data online should be handled with care, and responsability to ensure no personally identifiable information is included. We considered the ethical responsability we each hold as users of online data in a data driven world. One specific measure we took to protect the data we were using, was researching and understanding HIPAA laws in the United States. The CDC is a government run agency. 
Please ensure you are always practicing safe driving. This travel guide is for educational purposes only, and always consult a doctor before entering a flu zone.
